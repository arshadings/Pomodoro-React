How to setup the project in my local machine?
1. Download the project and import it in VSCode
2. Open terminal and navigate to the project folder (eg: xxxx\xxx\xxxx\pomodoro)
3. Run "npm install" to download all the dependencies
4. Run "npm i react-countdown-circle-timer", since this project uses an animation which already build in the mentioned component
